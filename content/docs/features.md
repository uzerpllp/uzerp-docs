uzERP is an Open Source modular business system designed for Small and Medium sized Enterprises (SME) or owner managed businesses. The system has modules that touch every business function:

* Lead and Opportunity tracking
* Customer Relationship management (CRM) including Activities and Campaigns
* "Order to cash" processing for both the sales and purchase processes including trade counter operations
* Asset and Project management
* Accounting - Sales, Purchase and General Ledger plus Cash Book
* Manufacturing management including requirements planning and shop floor data collection
* Stock Management with multi location Warehousing
* HR - personnel details, holiday & training records
* Quality and customer service monitoring
* Engineering and Maintenance task tracking

The Open Source nature of uzERP means that a business can implement any modules that are applicable to their environment. uzERP comes with no licensing cost, organisations can implement uzERP in a phased way without the *big bang* approach needed to get a quick payback from traditional upfront licence fees.

The above is just a small subset of what uzERP can do. Why not check out the [Demo](http://try.uzerp.com) online to get a flavour of what uzERP can do for your business.

## Interface Design

uzERP is web based so is accessible from any PC or Mac using a web browser - no client software is required.

Progressive disclosure provides a rich user experience with drop down menus, context sensitive defaults and lists. uzERPâ€™s clutter free workspace presents users with a familiar environment that can be navigated intuitively:

* List based displays provide a familiar 'spreadsheet like' interface to data
* All lists are searchable and printable meaning users can get the information they need quickly and easily
* In-list Links allow for *progressive disclosure* so users get the information they need quickly and intuitively
* A configurable and context sensitive sidebar provides access to more information or extra operations
* [[uzLETs|User-Manual/uzLETS]] provide desktop shortlists, graphs and quick links that put information right in front of users
