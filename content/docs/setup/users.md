**Review:**
* Users and roles are covered in [Initial Setup]({{< ref "docs/setup/initial-setup.md" >}}). Consider having documentation on users and roles in one place.

Post installation individual users must be added in using the Setup -> Admin -> Users -> New option. 

In most organisations users represent a specific individual, therefore if you added employee 'people' records to the system company a user can be associated with an individual staff member. This is not obligatory as there may be some system 'users' that represent a group or department, for example 'x_group' or 'cell_b'.

Each user gets a unique username and must be given a password. Their email can be entered here and if roles have been previously set up they can be allocated a role. Finally the system companies that they have access to must be highlighted.
