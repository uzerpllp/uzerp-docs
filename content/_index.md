# uzERP Business Management System

uzERP (pronounced yōō-zûrp) was originally developed to replace a commercial Unix based [ERP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) system by [Severn Delta Limited](http://www.severndelta.co.uk) using Open Source tools. We like to think it has been made **BY** small business people **FOR** small business people.

The system is now developed and maintained by uzERP LLP, an independent company set up by the owners of Severn Delta to further develop the software.
