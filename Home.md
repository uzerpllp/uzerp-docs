# uzERP Business Management System

uzERP (pronounced yōō-zûrp) was originally developed to replace a commercial Unix based [ERP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning) system by [Severn Delta Limited](http://www.severndelta.co.uk) using Open Source tools. We like to think it has been made BY small business people FOR small business people.

The system is now developed and maintained by uzERP LLP, an independent company set up by the owners of Severn Delta to further develop the software.
